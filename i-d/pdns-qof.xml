    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the output format used between Passive DNS query interface. The output format description includes also a common meaning per Passive DNS system.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Passive DNS is a technique described by Florian Weimer in 2005 in Passive DNS replication, F Weimer - 17th Annual FIRST Conference on Computer Security. Since then multiple Passive DNS implementations evolved over time. Users of these Passive DNS servers query a server (often via Whois [Ref: WHOIS]), parse the results and process them in other applications.</t>
     <t>
    There are multiple implementation of Passive DNS software. Users of passive DNS query each implementation and aggregate the results for their search. This document describes the output format of three Passive DNS Systems which are in use today and which already share a nearly identical output format.

As the format and the meaning of output fields from each Passive DNS need to be consistent, we propose in this document a solution to commonly name each field along with their cor
responding interpretation. The format format is following a simple key-value structure.

The benefit of having a consistent Passive DNS output format is that multiple client implementations can query different servers without having to have a separate parser for each
individual server. [http://code.google.com/p/passive-dns-query-tool/] currently implements multiple parsers due to a lack of standardization.

The document does not describe the protocol (e.g. whois ref:TOADD) used to query the Passive DNS.

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Mandatory Fields">
    <t>A field is composed a key followed by a value separated by the single ':' character and a space before the value. The format is based on the initial work done by Florian Weimer and the RIPE whois format (ref:http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/dnslogger/whois.html). The ordered of the fields is not significant for the same resource type, name tuple.</t>

    <section title="first_seen">
    <t>This field returns the first time that the record has been seen by the passive DNS. The date is expressed in ISO 8601 and UTC.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="last_seen">
    <t>This field returns the last time that the record has been seen by the passive DNS. The date is expressed in ISO 8601 and UTC.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="rrtype">
     <t>This field returns the resource record type as seen by the passive DNS. The key is rr-type and the value is in the interpreted record type. If the value cannot be interpreted the
     decimal value is returned.

     The resource record type can be any values as described by IANA in the DNS parameters document in the section 'DNS Label types' (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters).

      RFC 2434</xref> for a guide). If the draft does not require IANA to do
      anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
      case (as above). If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will
      be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.</t>

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
        (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

     Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
     filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                      v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                      other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                      Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                      figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                      Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                      added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                      images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
