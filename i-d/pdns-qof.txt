1.  Introduction

   Passive DNS is a technique described by Florian Weimer in 2005 in
   Passive DNS replication, F Weimer - 17th Annual FIRST Conference on
   Computer Security.  Since then multiple Passive DNS implementations
   evolved over time.  Users of these Passive DNS servers query a server
   (often via Whois [Ref: WHOIS]), parse the results and process them in
   other applications.

   There are multiple implementation of Passive DNS software.  Users of
   passive DNS query each implementation and aggregate the results for
   their search.  This document describes the output format of three
   Passive DNS Systems which are in use today and which already share a
   nearly identical output format.  As the format and the meaning of
   output fields from each Passive DNS need to be consistent, we propose
   in this document a solution to commonly name each field along with
   their cor responding interpretation.  The format format is following
   a simple key-value structure.  The benefit of having a consistent
   Passive DNS output format is that multiple client implementations can
   query different servers without having to have a separate parser for
   each individual server.  [http://code.google.com/p/passive-dns-query-
   tool/] currently implements multiple parsers due to a lack of
   standardization.  The document does not describe the protocol (e.g.
   whois ref:TOADD) used to query the Passive DNS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Mandatory Fields

   A field is composed a key followed by a value separated by the single
   ':' character and a space before the value.  The format is based on
   the initial work done by Florian Weimer and the RIPE whois format
   (ref:http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/dnslogger/whois.html). The
   ordered of the fields is not significant for the same resource type,
   name tuple.

2.1.  first_seen

   This field returns the first time that the record has been seen by
   the passive DNS. The date is expressed in ISO 8601 and UTC.

2.2.  last_seen

   This field returns the last time that the record has been seen by the
   passive DNS. The date is expressed in ISO 8601 and UTC.

2.3.  rrtype

Internet-Draft             Abbreviated Title                January 2013


   This field returns the resource record type as seen by the passive
   DNS. The key is rr-type and the value is in the interpreted record
   type.  If the value cannot be interpreted the decimal value is
   returned.  The resource record type can be any values as described by
   IANA in the DNS parameters document in the section 'DNS Label types'
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters).

2.4.  rrname

   This field returns the name of the queried resource.

3.  Optional Fields

3.1.  sensor_id

3.2.  count

   Specifies how many authoritative answers were received with the set
   of answers (i.e.  same data) over all sensors.  The number of
   requests is expressed as a decimal value.

3.3.  ttl

3.4.  bailiwick

4.  Acknowledgements

   This template was derived from an initial version written by Pekka
   Savola and contributed by him to the xml2rfc project.

   This document is part of a plan to make xml2rfc indispensable
   [DOMINATION].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   the update of RFC 2434 [I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis]
   for a guide). If the draft does not require IANA to do anything, the
   section contains an explicit statement that this is the case (as
   above). If there are no requirements for IANA, the section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

6.  Security Considerations

   All drafts are required to have a security considerations section.
   See RFC 3552 [RFC3552] for a guide.
