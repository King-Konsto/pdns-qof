1.  Introduction

   Passive DNS is a technique described by Florian Weimer in 2005 in
   Passive DNS replication, F Weimer - 17th Annual FIRST Conference on
   Computer Security.  Since then multiple Passive DNS implementations
   evolved over time.  Users of these Passive DNS servers query a server
   (often via Whois [Ref: WHOIS] or HTTP and ReST), parse the results
   and process them in other applications.

   There are multiple implementation of Passive DNS software.  Users of
   passive DNS query each implementation and aggregate the results for
   their search.  This document describes the output format of three
   Passive DNS Systems which are in use today and which already share a
   nearly identical output format.  As the format and the meaning of
   output fields from each Passive DNS need to be consistent, we propose
   in this document a solution to commonly name each field along with
   their corresponding interpretation.  The format format is following a
   simple key-value structure in JSON [RFC4627] format.  The benefit of
   having a consistent Passive DNS output format is that multiple client
   implementations can query different servers without having to have a
   separate parser for each individual server.  [http://code.google.com/
   p/passive-dns-query-tool/] currently implements multiple parsers due
   to a lack of standardization.  The document does not describe the
   protocol (e.g.  whois, HTTP REST or XMPP) nor the query format used
   to query the Passive DNS. Neither does this document describe "pre-
   recursor" Passive DNS Systems.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Limitation

   As a Passive DNS can include protection mechanisms for their
   operation, results might be different due to those protection
   measures.  These mechanisms filter out DNS answers if they fail some
   criteria.  The bailiwick algorithm (c.f.  http://www.isc.org/files/
   passive_dns_hardening_handout.pdf) protects the Passive DNS Database
   from cache poisoning attacks [ref: Dan Kaminsky].  Another
   limitiation that clients querying the database need to be aware of is



Dulaunoy, Kaplan, Vixie & Stern   info                          [Page 2]

Internet-Draft             Abbreviated Title                  April 2013

   that each query simply gets an snapshot-answer of the time of
   querying.  Clients MUST NOT rely on consistent answers.

3.  Common Output Format

   The formatting of the answer follows the JSON [RFC4627] format.  The
   order of the fields is not significant for the same resource type.
   That means, the same name tuple plus timing information identifies a
   unique answer per server.

3.1.  Overview and Example

   The intent of this output format is to be easily parseable by
   scripts.  Every implementation MUST support the JSON output format.

   A sample output using the JSON format:

   ... (list of )...
   { "count": 97167,
   "time_first": "2010-06-25 17:07:02",
   "rrtype": "A", "rrname": "google-public-dns-a.google.com.",
   "rdata": "8.8.8.8",
   "time_last": "2013-02-05 17:34:03" }
   ... (separated by newline)...

3.2.  Mandatory Fields

   Implementation MUST support all the mandatory fields.

   The tuple (rrtype,rrname,rdata) will always be unique within one
   answer per server.

3.2.1.  rrname

   This field returns the name of the queried resource.

3.2.2.  rrtype

   This field returns the resource record type as seen by the passive
   DNS. The key is rrtype and the value is in the interpreted record
   type.  If the value cannot be interpreted the decimal value is
   returned following the principle of transparency as described in RFC
   3597 [RFC3597].  The resource record type can be any values as
   described by IANA in the DNS parameters document in the section 'DNS
   Label types' (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters).
   Currently known and supported textual descritptions of rrtypes are:
   A, AAAA, CNAME, PTR, SOA, TXT, DNAME, NS, SRV, RP, NAPTR, HINFO, A6 A
   client MUST be able to understand these textual rtype values.  In
   addition, a client MUST be able to handle a decimal value (as
   mentioned above) as answer.

3.2.3.  rdata





Dulaunoy, Kaplan, Vixie & Stern   info                          [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Abbreviated Title                  April 2013


   This field returns the data of the queried resource.  In general,
   this is to be interpreted as string.  Depending on the rtype, this
   can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address, a domain name (as in the case of
   CNAMEs), an SPF record, etc.  A client MUST be able to interpret any
   value which is legal as the right hand side in a DNS zone file  RFC
   1035 [RFC1035] and RFC 1034 [RFC1034].  If the rdata came from an
   unknown DNS resource records, the server must follow the transparency
   principle as described in RFC 3597 [RFC3597].  (binary stream if any?
   base64?)

3.2.4.  time_first

   This field returns the first time that the record / unique tuple
   (rrname, rrtype, rdata) has been seen by the passive DNS. The date is
   expressed in seconds (decimal ascii) since 1st of January 1970 (unix
   timestamp). The time zone MUST be UTC.

3.2.5.  time_last

   This field returns the last time that the unique tuple (rrname,
   rrtype, rdata) record has been seen by the passive DNS. The date is
   expressed in seconds (decimal ascii) since 1st of January 1970 (unix
   timestamp). The time zone MUST be UTC..

3.3.  Optional Fields

   Implementation SHOULD support one or more field.

3.3.1.  count

   Specifies how many answers were received with the set of answers
   (i.e.  same data). The number of requests is expressed as a decimal
   value.

   Specifies the number of times this particular event denoted by the
   other type fields has been seen in the given time interval (between
   time_last and time_first). Decimal number.

3.3.2.  bailiwick

   The bailiwick is the best estimate of the apex of the zone where this
   data is authoritative.  String.

3.4.  Additional Fields

   Implementations MAY support the following fields:

3.4.1.  sensor_id

   This field returns the sensor information where the record was seen.
   The sensor_id is an opaque byte string as defined by RFC 5001 in
   section 2.3 [RFC5001].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   In some cases, Passive DNS output might contain confidential
   information and its access might be restricted.  When an user is
   querying multiple Passive DNS and aggregating the data, the
   sensitivity of the data must be considered.
